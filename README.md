# Description

A repository to keep track of all my open source contributions. But, why?

### Behind the Story

Simply just because I found contributing to open source is very intimidating... then it was not simple at all. It was toxic.

And then I have chosen to create this list of every open source pull request I have made here... proudly even so many ninjas there. Seems like I finally took a leap of faith and jumped into the world of the open source community. Here's some orange juice... üçπüçπüçπ
